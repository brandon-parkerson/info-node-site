# info-node-site

This is a very basic project displaying the ability to create a node server that displays certain pages/info based on the path chosen by the client. This was a way to solidify my understanding of creating a node server, parsing the url and reading a file based on that data, and having an error handling page when a user tries to access an unavailable/non-existent page.
